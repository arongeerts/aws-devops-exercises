CloudFormation Exercise 4:

You are getting pretty good at putting things in a CloudFormation template, now let's see what you can get out of them.
Create a bucket called
`aws-devops-session-2-<YOUR_NAME>-ex4`, by using only your name as the input parameter. As a result of the stack, return the ARN as "BucketArn" and the Domain name as "URL".

You can check whether your solution is correct by checking the AWS console to see if your bucket was created.
Your outputs should be visible in the CloudFormation console.
