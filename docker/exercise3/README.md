# Docker Exercise 3:

Now let us do the same as in exercise 2, but bake the file into the docker image.
For this exercise you will have to:
1. Create a Dockerfile in which you copy the script into the image
2. set the default command to execute the python file
3. Build the image
4. Run it with `docker <run my-image>`
