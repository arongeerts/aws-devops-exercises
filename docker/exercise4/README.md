# Docker Exercise 4:

Well, printing stuff is not that impressive. Can you run an API too?
In the `api.py` script is the code to run a python api.
In the `requirements.txt`, you will find the requirements to run this, which you can install by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Build a Docker image, in which you install the requirements and run the api. If you did well, you should be able to see the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

TIP: you will have to map the port of the container to the port of your machine!
