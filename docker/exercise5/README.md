# Docker Exercise 5:

In your app, you will probably need some environment variables to determine whether you are running in dev or prod.
Build the app again, but make sure you can run the same image in both development and production by overwriting the `APP_ENV` variable

TIP: you will have to map the port of the container to the port of your machine!
